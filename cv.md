# Summary

As a schoolboy, I spent almost all my free time surfing the Internet. Since I was interested in information technology and everything related to the internet before, I decided to try my hand at programming.<br>

So, starting 2019, web development became a part of my life. Learning intermittently, taking courses and trying my hand at freelancing many goals were achieved. Four real commercial projects have been completed.<br>

I'm currently 18 years old and studying to be a data engineer, gaining all the knowledge to make the world a better place and also to become a professional web developer.<br>
